# INTENT: Spirituality

## Purpose

- Follow the Spirit as perfectly as I can, keeping my inner life aligned with
  truth, love, and obedience.

## End State

- Daily decisions are guided by prayerful listening and clear conscience.
- My life reflects humility, gratitude, and integrity.
- Practices deepen attention, peace, and responsiveness to the Spirit.
- Spiritual life nourishes relationships and work rather than competing with
  them.

## Constraints

- Do not compromise conscience for comfort, speed, or reputation.
- Avoid practices that dull attention, foster ego, or erode sincerity.
- Keep commitments small enough to sustain consistently.

## Tradeoffs

- Depth over breadth.
- Obedience over self-promotion.
- Silence and solitude over noise and validation.

## Risk tolerance

- High for new practices that increase clarity and humility.
- Low for anything that disrupts conscience, trust, or stability.

## Escalation conditions

- Persistent loss of peace or clarity.
- Repeated conflict between actions and conscience.
- Spiritual practices become performative or hollow.

## Verification steps

- Weekly review of alignment, peace, and attentiveness.
- Monthly audit of commitments and practices.
- Quarterly revalidation of this intent with honest reflection.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new spirituality intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major life changes.
