# INTENT: Relationships

## Purpose

- Love people well, with relationships grounded in presence, care, and truth.

## End State

- Closest relationships feel safe, attentive, and durable.
- Communication is clear, truthful, and kind even in conflict.
- Time and energy are allocated to the people who matter most.
- Community life reflects generosity and mutual support.

## Constraints

- Do not sacrifice integrity to avoid discomfort.
- Avoid relationships that require inauthenticity or chronic self-betrayal.
- Do not let work schedules routinely crowd out people.

## Tradeoffs

- Explicit priority order: God → Traci → kids → cofounders → SueAnn → extended
  family → coworkers/business partners → church family → neighbors →
  community → country → world.
- Depth over breadth.
- Consistency over intensity.
- Presence over productivity.

## Risk tolerance

- Medium for difficult conversations that protect trust.
- Low for patterns that erode safety, honesty, or respect.

## Escalation conditions

- Repeated misalignment between words and actions.
- Relationships feel performative, brittle, or unsafe.
- Chronic isolation or avoidance of conflict.

## Verification steps

- Weekly check-in on relational health and presence.
- Monthly review of time allocation and neglected relationships.
- Quarterly revalidation of priorities and boundaries.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new relationships intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major relationship changes.
