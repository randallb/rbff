# INTENT: Health

## Purpose

- Steward my body and mind so I can follow the Spirit, love people well, and
  sustain long-term work.

## End State

- Energy is steady and sleep is reliable.
- Strength, mobility, and endurance are improving or maintained.
- Nutrition supports clarity, stability, and recovery.
- Health routines are simple, consistent, and sustainable.
- I stay alive as long as I am supposed to.
- I preserve free agency to do my best work, not the work limited by poor early
  choices.

## Constraints

- Do not trade sleep or recovery for short-term wins.
- Avoid extreme protocols that cannot be sustained.
- Protect health over productivity.

## Tradeoffs

- Consistency over intensity.
- Recovery over volume.
- Simplicity over optimization.

## Risk tolerance

- Medium for experimentation with routines that are reversible.
- Low for anything that risks injury or chronic depletion.

## Escalation conditions

- Sustained fatigue, pain, or cognitive fog.
- Sleep disruption persists beyond a short window.
- Health routines become brittle or obsessive.

## Verification steps

- Weekly review of sleep, energy, and training adherence.
- Monthly review of key health indicators.
- Quarterly revalidation of routines and goals.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new health intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major health changes.
