# Edit Notes: Build less, ship more

Source draft: `build-less-ship-more.md`

## Definitions / framing to clarify

- Title: define “build less” (less rework? fewer false starts?) and “agentic coworkers” (Codex/Claude-style tool-running agents).
- “verification steps”: add 1 concrete example so it’s not abstract.
- “command and control”: specify which failure mode you mean (micro-decisions, hidden intent, unclear success conditions, etc.).

## Claims that need a yardstick (quality/effort)

- “higher quality…less effort”: define what “quality” and “effort” mean (fewer regressions, fewer follow-ups, less review time, faster cycle time, etc.).
- “feature right the first time”: define “right” (tests pass, UX criteria met, no follow-up fixes?) and clarify “haven’t written code” (hands-on coding vs oversight/spec/review).

## Phrasing that implies extra machinery

- “discover the right information at precisely the right moment”: clarify whether this is docs/decks, tool-assisted search, retrieval, or human-provided context.
- “builds the ‘mindset’ of the model”: consider reframing as “shapes behavior via context at inference time” to avoid anthropomorphism.

## Spots to qualify / tighten (reader trust)

- “Machine learning means Bayesian regression normally”: either qualify (classic stats framing) or remove.
- “prompt engineering…pejorative”: clarify who treats it that way + fix the sentence/grammar.
- “Washington…more founder mode than the Brits”: soften or support; it reads as a big historical claim.
- “2020s Apple…without the iPhone”: clarify the intended contrast; currently hard to parse.

## “This post” polish

- “this conversation”: change to “this post” (or explicitly frame as a conversation/transcript).
- “before we start building”: specify “building what” (software? any project?) and “with what” (LLMs/agents?).
- “Allowed Changes”: define what this field means (what the agent can change without asking vs scope boundaries).
