# INTENT: Home

## Purpose

- Maintain a home that supports peace, recovery, creativity, and hospitality.

## End State

- The home is orderly, welcoming, and restful.
- Spaces support focused work, family life, and spiritual practice.
- Maintenance is predictable and rarely urgent.
- The home feels like a refuge, not a source of stress.

## Constraints

- Do not let clutter or neglect accumulate beyond quick recovery.
- Avoid purchases or changes that increase long-term maintenance burden.
- Protect shared spaces as shared; avoid unilateral changes.

## Tradeoffs

- Calm over novelty.
- Function over aesthetics.
- Simplicity over accumulation.

## Risk tolerance

- Medium for experiments that improve flow or comfort.
- Low for changes that increase stress or recurring costs.

## Escalation conditions

- The home consistently feels chaotic or draining.
- Maintenance becomes reactive rather than scheduled.
- Shared spaces become sources of conflict.

## Verification steps

- Weekly reset and review of shared spaces.
- Monthly maintenance check.
- Quarterly revalidation of home systems.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new home intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major household changes.
