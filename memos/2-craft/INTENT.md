# INTENT: Craft

## Purpose

- Develop and practice my craft so my work reflects excellence, integrity, and
  service.

## End State

- I consistently create high-quality work that compounds over time.
- Skills deepen through deliberate practice and honest feedback.
- Craft serves the Spirit and people rather than ego or recognition.
- Output is sustainable and aligned with long-term priorities.

## Constraints

- Do not chase novelty at the expense of depth.
- Avoid work that requires misalignment with conscience.
- Protect time for deep practice.

## Tradeoffs

- Depth over breadth.
- Mastery over speed.
- Service over status.

## Risk tolerance

- High for experiments that deepen skill.
- Low for shortcuts that erode quality or integrity.

## Escalation conditions

- Work becomes performative or driven by approval.
- Craft time is consistently crowded out.
- Quality declines without a clear recovery plan.

## Verification steps

- Weekly review of craft time and output.
- Monthly review of skill growth and feedback.
- Quarterly portfolio and direction review.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new craft intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major shifts in focus.
