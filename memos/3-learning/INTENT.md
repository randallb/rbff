# INTENT: Learning

## Purpose

- Keep learning aligned with the Spirit and in service of the people and work I
  care about most.

## End State

- Learning priorities are clear and focused.
- I read, study, and practice consistently without drowning in inputs.
- New knowledge translates into better decisions and better work.
- Curiosity is alive without becoming distraction.

## Constraints

- Do not let information intake displace action.
- Avoid open loops that never turn into application.
- Protect time for reflection and synthesis.

## Tradeoffs

- Depth over breadth.
- Application over accumulation.
- Focus over novelty.

## Risk tolerance

- High for experiments that sharpen understanding.
- Low for habits that create noise or distraction.

## Escalation conditions

- Learning becomes procrastination or avoidance.
- Inputs overwhelm ability to apply.
- Core priorities are neglected for new topics.

## Verification steps

- Weekly review of learning focus and output.
- Monthly check for application to real decisions.
- Quarterly revalidation of learning themes.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new learning intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major shifts in focus.
