# INTENT: Community

## Purpose

- Contribute to the community with humility, presence, and service.

## End State

- I show up consistently for my church and local community.
- Community commitments are aligned with priorities and capacity.
- Relationships in community are genuine, not transactional.
- I contribute to the common good with time, skill, and resources.

## Constraints

- Do not overcommit at the expense of family and core responsibilities.
- Avoid performative service or status-driven involvement.
- Keep commitments reliable and realistic.

## Tradeoffs

- Depth over breadth.
- Service over recognition.
- Presence over visibility.

## Risk tolerance

- Medium for new commitments that strengthen community.
- Low for involvement that causes resentment or burnout.

## Escalation conditions

- Community life feels performative or draining.
- Commitments crowd out family or spiritual practices.
- Relationships feel shallow or transactional.

## Verification steps

- Weekly reflection on engagement and presence.
- Monthly review of commitments and capacity.
- Quarterly revalidation of community focus.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new community intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major changes in involvement.
