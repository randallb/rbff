# INTENT: Systems

## Purpose

- Build simple systems that support spiritual alignment, relationships, health,
  and craft without becoming the point.

## End State

- Systems are light, reliable, and easy to maintain.
- Reviews and planning produce clarity, not bureaucracy.
- Tools serve the work; the work does not serve the tools.
- I can recover quickly from drift or disruption.

## Constraints

- Avoid complexity that requires constant maintenance.
- Do not add tools without removing or simplifying others.
- Keep reviews short enough to be sustainable.

## Tradeoffs

- Simplicity over sophistication.
- Consistency over optimization.
- Clarity over completeness.

## Risk tolerance

- High for experiments that reduce cognitive load.
- Low for systems that create dependency or fragility.

## Escalation conditions

- The system feels heavy or time-consuming.
- Reviews are skipped or avoided consistently.
- Tools become a substitute for execution.

## Verification steps

- Weekly review of system friction and utility.
- Monthly review of toolset and routines.
- Quarterly revalidation of the overall system design.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new systems intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major workflow changes.
