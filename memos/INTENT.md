# Life Intent

## Purpose

- Follow the Spirit as perfectly as I can.

## End State

- Daily decisions reflect spiritual guidance over ego, fear, or impulse.
- Relationships are loving, honest, and aligned with that guidance.
- Work and creativity serve the Spirit rather than displace it.
- Health and habits support clarity, presence, and stamina.
- Life feels coherent, peaceful, and steady.

## Constraints

- Do not violate conscience for ambition, status, or speed.
- Do not prioritize productivity over spiritual alignment.
- Avoid commitments that consistently pull me away from presence.
- Keep systems simple enough to sustain in both calm and chaos.

## Tradeoffs

- Alignment over output.
- Depth over breadth.
- Long-term integrity over short-term gains.

## Risk tolerance

- High for experiments that increase spiritual clarity.
- Low for actions that threaten health, trust, or integrity.

## Escalation conditions

- Persistent loss of peace, clarity, or prayerful focus.
- Repeated conflict between actions and conscience.
- Relationships feel strained, performative, or unsafe.
- Any area intent conflicts with this life intent.

## Verification steps

- Weekly review of alignment, peace, relationships, and health.
- Monthly review of commitments, habits, and drift.
- Quarterly intent revalidation and adjustment.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new life intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major life changes.
