# Life Intent

## Purpose

- Live with clarity, integrity, and depth while building a life that supports
  meaningful work, strong relationships, and sustained well-being.

## End State

- A stable rhythm that balances deep work, rest, and relationships.
- Physical and mental health are resilient and improving.
- Financial systems are predictable and reduce stress.
- Creative and professional output compounds over time.
- The home environment supports focus, recovery, and hospitality.

## Constraints

- Do not trade long-term health or trust for short-term wins.
- Avoid chronic overcommitment; protect recovery time.
- Keep personal systems simple enough to maintain during busy seasons.

## Tradeoffs

- Depth over breadth.
- Fewer high-leverage projects over many shallow ones.
- Consistency over intensity.

## Risk tolerance

- High for creative experiments and reversible choices.
- Low for health, trust, and financial stability.

## Escalation conditions

- Repeated burnout signals or sustained sleep/energy collapse.
- Persistent relationship strain or loss of trust.
- Financial instability that threatens basic needs.
- Any area intent conflicts with this life intent.

## Verification steps

- Weekly review of energy, output, relationships, and health signals.
- Monthly review of finances, systems, and progress on key projects.
- Quarterly intent revalidation and adjustment.

## Activation / revalidation

- Active immediately upon adoption.
- Superseded when a new life intent is explicitly adopted.
- Revalidate quarterly or after major life changes.
